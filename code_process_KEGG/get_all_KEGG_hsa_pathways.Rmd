Load the KEGGREST package, which gives access to the KEGGREST API:

```{r}
library(KEGGREST)
listDatabases()
```


```{r}
##get all pathways (hsa = homo sapiens)
all_path_KEGG <- keggList("pathway", organism="hsa")
length(all_path_KEGG)
head(all_path_KEGG)
```

Download all the human pathways as KGML files (this is a KEGG-specific XML format):

```{r}
##now get all kgml files for all pathways
for(path in names(all_path_KEGG))
{
  path_name <- gsub("path:","",path)
  path_kgml <- keggGet(path, "kgml")
  write(path_kgml, paste("../All_human_pathways_KGML/",
                         path_name, ".kgml",
                         sep=""))
}
```
